# Semantic_Alignment_in_Dialogue

Speakers have been shown to adapt to their partner in dialogue at many levels of communication: how fast they talk, the words they use, or their style and manner of speaking, amongst others. Understanding better how humans communicate with one another is a very interesting topic in itself, and is also essential for the creation of human-like dialogue systems. This project involves using contemporary large pretrained language models as a tool to investigate the extent to which semantic alignment (alignment of meaning) plays a role in dialogue. Both task oriented, and conversational dialogue will be considered. Results will aim to replicate and build on prior findings of local semantic alignment but global semantic divergence, exploring in more depth what contributes to these findings. A goal of this project is to start to disentangle the semantic alignment of topic words from those between related conversational contexts. E.g. ‘I like cars’ ‘I like vehicles’ will be very similar semantically, for both the topic ‘cars/vehicles’ and the conversational context of exchanging likes.
